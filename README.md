# Overview
In this project I developed an [AI Dungeon Master](https://nathan-wheeler.github.io/ai_dungeon_master/) website. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, on this website players can play a Dungeons and Dragons adventure starring Bingo Buggins, a renowned halfling thief. As Bingo Buggins, players are tasked by a grand duke to retrieve a family tome from a crypt lost in the catacombs beneath the city. However, along the way players may discover that there may be more to this tome than meets the eye.
